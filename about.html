          <p>
            As a first-year Computer Science student at Rishihood University, I am passionate to solve real-world problems 
            and aspire to become a software engineer. Skilled in Python, UI/UX design, and web development with HTML, CSS, 
            and JavaScript, I focus on building intuitive and impactful solutions. My interests lie in exploring Artificial 
            Intelligence and its transformative potential, while my experience in projects and hackathons has honed my teamwork 
            and problem-solving skills. I'm a curious learner and a creative thinker, eager to connect with like-minded individuals 
            to shape the future of technology.
